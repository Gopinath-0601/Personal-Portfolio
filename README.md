WHO AM I?
Hello! I'm Siva, a passionate game developer with over 4.5 years of experience! My love for game development ignited at a young age, and I’ve been sharpening my skills in the Unity Engine and c# ever since. I specialize in crafting exciting Hyper-casual, Casual, Idle, and Puzzle games for both Android and IOS platforms. With more than 65+ Games under my belt, I'm thrilled to bring your creative game ideas to life!

HOW I BEGAN MY JOURNEY IN GAME DEVELOPMENT?

In 2020, during my final semester of college, I had the idea to create a humorous game as a birthday gift for my brother. He became the main character in the game, where he had to collect junk food to score points. I watched several Unity tutorial videos and began developing the game in mid-September, completing it before the first week of October. It turned out even better than I had anticipated, and when I presented it to my brother on his birthday, he was so happy that I made it just for him. That was the beginning of my journey into game development.
